        <p>vision is to foster thriving and resilient local communities. Guided by our mission, we empower communities to build resilience and achieve sustainable growth by addressing critical development priorities such as Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), environmental sustainability, climate action, research and development, and the integration of technology into sustainable development initiatives.</p>

We actively collaborate with partners, academic institutions, volunteers, and interns to amplify our reach and impact.</p>
        
        <p>Our impactful projects include providing water supply to Nyamatuta community and schools, implementing a GBV case reporting and management system, running environmental and  climate change education programs in schools, and promoting eco-friendly banana-based packaging as a plastic alternative.</p>
        
        <p>ISCoD Kenya has partnered with renowned organizations such as the European Union, International Solidarity Foundation (ISF-Kenya), +1 Global Fund for WASH, and World Relief Australia.</p>
